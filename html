            <h1>Introduction to Virtual Reality (VR)</h1>
            <h3>
                Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that creates a simulated environment, allowing users to interact
                with it in a seemingly real way. VR typically requires specialized equipment such as a headset, sensors,
                and controllers to create an immersive experience. Unlike Augmented Reality (AR), which overlays digital
                content on the real world, VR creates a completely digital environment.
            </h3>

            <h3>
                VR is used in various industries such as entertainment, healthcare, education, and military training.
                In entertainment, VR is commonly used in gaming, where players can enter fully interactive 3D worlds.
                In healthcare, VR is used for surgical simulations, therapy, and rehabilitation.
            </h3>

            <h3>
                Key components of a VR system include a VR headset (which covers the eyes and displays the virtual world),
                motion tracking (to track user movements and adjust the virtual environment accordingly), and controllers
                (to allow interaction with the virtual world). Some VR systems also include haptic feedback to simulate the
                sense of touch.
            </h3>

            <h3>
                As VR technology advances, it has the potential to transform how we learn, work, and play. VR could
                revolutionize fields such as remote collaboration, virtual tourism, and more. However, VR also raises
                challenges such as motion sickness and the high cost of hardware.
